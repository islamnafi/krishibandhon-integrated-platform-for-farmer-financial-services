   git clone https://github.com/your-username/krishibandhon-integrated-platform-for-farmer-financial-and-advisory-services.git
   cd krishibandhon-integrated-platform-for-farmer-financial-and-advisory-services

   ```

## Notes

- The project uses `managed = False` in Django models, which means the database schema already exists and Django won't attempt to create or modify the tables.
- Make sure your database schema matches the defined models.


## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication and role-based access
- Farmer dashboards and analytics
- REST API support for mobile or frontend integration
- Application tracking for grants, loans, and insurance
